# Sensor Manager

The Sensor Manager is a specialized component of the Distributed IoT Platform responsible for managing IoT sensors, collecting sensor data, and providing sensor data processing capabilities.

## Overview

The Sensor Manager plays a crucial role in the Distributed IoT Platform by handling all aspects of IoT sensor management. It provides capabilities for sensor registration, data collection, data processing, and data distribution. The Sensor Manager acts as a bridge between physical IoT devices and the platform, enabling applications to interact with sensors in a standardized way.

## Key Features

- **Sensor Registration**: Manages the registration of sensors with the platform
- **Sensor Discovery**: Supports discovery of available sensors
- **Data Collection**: Collects data from connected sensors
- **Data Processing**: Processes and transforms sensor data
- **Data Distribution**: Distributes sensor data to applications
- **Sensor Monitoring**: Monitors sensor health and status
- **Protocol Support**: Supports multiple IoT protocols
- **Sensor Configuration**: Manages sensor configuration
- **Data Storage**: Stores sensor data for historical analysis

## Architecture

The Sensor Manager follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Sensor Registry**: Manages sensor registration and metadata
- **Protocol Adapters**: Supports various IoT protocols
- **Data Collector**: Collects data from sensors
- **Data Processor**: Processes and transforms sensor data
- **Data Distributor**: Distributes data to applications
- **Sensor Monitor**: Monitors sensor health
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### Sensor Registry

Manages sensor registration and metadata:
- Handles sensor registration
- Stores sensor metadata
- Provides sensor discovery
- Manages sensor groups
- Tracks sensor status

### Protocol Adapters

Supports various IoT protocols:
- MQTT adapter
- CoAP adapter
- HTTP/REST adapter
- WebSocket adapter
- Custom protocol adapters

### Data Collector

Collects data from sensors:
- Establishes connections to sensors
- Receives sensor data
- Validates data format
- Handles data buffering
- Manages collection frequency

### Data Processor

Processes and transforms sensor data:
- Filters data
- Aggregates data
- Transforms data formats
- Enriches data with metadata
- Applies data quality rules

### Data Distributor

Distributes data to applications:
- Publishes data to Kafka topics
- Implements publish-subscribe patterns
- Manages data routing
- Handles data delivery guarantees
- Supports data filtering

### Sensor Monitor

Monitors sensor health:
- Tracks sensor connectivity
- Monitors data quality
- Detects sensor failures
- Generates sensor alerts
- Tracks sensor performance

## Workflow

1. **Sensor Registration**:
   - Sensors register with the platform
   - Sensor metadata is stored
   - Sensor is assigned to groups
   - Initial configuration is applied

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Connections are established to sensors
   - Data is collected based on configuration
   - Data is validated and buffered
   - Collection statistics are tracked

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Raw data is processed
   - Data is filtered and transformed
   - Data is enriched with metadata
   - Data quality is assessed

4. **Data Distribution**:
   - Processed data is published to Kafka
   - Data is routed to interested applications
   - Delivery is confirmed
   - Distribution statistics are tracked

5. **Sensor Monitoring**:
   - Sensor health is continuously monitored
   - Issues are detected and reported
   - Alerts are generated for problems
   - Recovery actions are initiated

## Integration with Other Components

The Sensor Manager integrates with several other platform components:

- **Sensor API Gateway**: Provides external access to sensor APIs
- **Monitoring & Fault Tolerance**: Reports sensor health
- **Logger**: Logs sensor activities
- **Node Manager**: Coordinates sensor distribution
- **Applications**: Provides sensor data to applications

# Load Balancer

The Load Balancer is a critical component of the Distributed IoT Platform responsible for distributing incoming requests across multiple service instances to ensure optimal resource utilization and high availability.

## Overview

The Load Balancer plays a crucial role in the Distributed IoT Platform by distributing incoming requests across multiple service instances. It ensures that no single instance is overwhelmed with requests, optimizes resource utilization, and provides high availability by routing traffic away from failed instances. The Load Balancer works closely with the Node Manager to make intelligent routing decisions based on node health and load.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Distribution**: Distributes incoming requests across service instances
- **Health Checking**: Monitors the health of service instances
- **Failover Handling**: Routes traffic away from failed instances
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains session affinity when required
- **Load-Based Routing**: Routes requests based on instance load
- **Protocol Support**: Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, etc.)
- **SSL Termination**: Handles SSL/TLS encryption and decryption
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls request rates to protect services
- **Request Filtering**: Filters requests based on rules
- **Metrics Collection**: Collects performance and traffic metrics

## Architecture

The Load Balancer follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Request Router**: Routes incoming requests
- **Health Checker**: Monitors service health
- **Load Monitor**: Tracks instance load
- **Routing Algorithm**: Implements routing strategies
- **Session Manager**: Handles session persistence
- **Protocol Handler**: Supports multiple protocols
- **Metrics Collector**: Collects performance metrics
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### Request Router

Routes incoming requests:
- Receives incoming requests
- Applies routing rules
- Selects target instance
- Forwards request to instance
- Handles response

### Health Checker

Monitors service health:
- Performs regular health checks
- Detects failed instances
- Updates instance status
- Coordinates with Node Manager
- Triggers failover actions

### Load Monitor

Tracks instance load:
- Collects load metrics
- Calculates load scores
- Identifies overloaded instances
- Provides load information for routing
- Triggers load balancing actions

### Routing Algorithm

Implements routing strategies:
- Round-robin routing
- Least connections routing
- Weighted routing
- Response time-based routing
- Custom routing strategies

### Session Manager

Handles session persistence:
- Maintains session affinity
- Tracks session information
- Maps sessions to instances
- Handles session failover
- Manages session timeouts

### Protocol Handler

Supports multiple protocols:
- HTTP/HTTPS handling
- TCP/UDP support
- WebSocket support
- gRPC support
- Custom protocol adapters

### Metrics Collector

Collects performance metrics:
- Request counts
- Response times
- Error rates
- Instance load
- Traffic distribution

## Workflow

1. **Request Reception**:
   - Request is received
   - Protocol is identified
   - Request is parsed
   - Routing rules are applied

2. **Instance Selection**:
   - Available instances are identified
   - Health status is checked
   - Load information is considered
   - Session affinity is checked
   - Target instance is selected

3. **Request Forwarding**:
   - Request is forwarded to target instance
   - Request tracking is initiated
   - Timeout monitoring is started
   - Metrics are updated

4. **Response Handling**:
   - Response is received from instance
   - Response is processed
   - Response is returned to client
   - Metrics are updated

5. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Regular health checks are performed
   - Failed instances are detected
   - Instance status is updated
   - Failover actions are triggered

## Integration with Other Components

The Load Balancer integrates with several other platform components:

- **Node Manager**: Coordinates on node health and load
- **API Gateway**: Receives requests from API Gateway
- **Monitoring & Fault Tolerance**: Reports load balancer health
- **Logger**: Logs load balancing activities
- **All Platform Services**: Routes requests to services

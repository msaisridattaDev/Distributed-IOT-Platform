# Logger

The Logger is a centralized logging component of the Distributed IoT Platform responsible for collecting, processing, storing, and visualizing logs from all platform components.

## Overview

The Logger provides a comprehensive logging solution for the Distributed IoT Platform. It collects logs from all platform components, processes and enriches the log data, stores it in a centralized repository, and provides interfaces for log analysis and visualization. The Logger plays a crucial role in troubleshooting, monitoring, and auditing the platform.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Logging**: Collects logs from all platform components
- **Log Processing**: Processes and enriches log data
- **Log Storage**: Stores logs in a centralized repository
- **Log Visualization**: Provides interfaces for log visualization
- **Log Analysis**: Supports log analysis and querying
- **Log Filtering**: Allows filtering logs by various criteria
- **Log Retention**: Manages log retention policies
- **Log Forwarding**: Supports forwarding logs to external systems
- **Log Security**: Ensures secure handling of log data

## Architecture

The Logger follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Log Collector**: Collects logs from platform components
- **Log Processor**: Processes and enriches log data
- **Log Storage**: Stores logs in a centralized repository
- **Log API**: Provides APIs for log access
- **Log UI**: Provides a user interface for log visualization
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### Log Collector

Collects logs from various sources:
- Kafka log topics
- Direct log submissions
- File-based logs
- Container logs
- System logs

### Log Processor

Processes and enriches log data:
- Parses log formats
- Extracts log fields
- Adds metadata
- Normalizes log entries
- Filters sensitive information

### Log Storage

Stores logs in a centralized repository:
- Manages log indices
- Implements storage policies
- Handles log rotation
- Manages log retention
- Optimizes storage usage

### Log API

Provides APIs for log access:
- Log querying
- Log filtering
- Log aggregation
- Log export
- Log statistics

### Log UI

Provides a user interface for log visualization:
- Log dashboards
- Log search
- Log filtering
- Log timeline
- Log details

## Workflow

1. **Log Collection**:
   - Platform components send logs to Kafka
   - Log Collector consumes logs from Kafka
   - Direct log submissions are received via API

2. **Log Processing**:
   - Logs are parsed and validated
   - Log fields are extracted
   - Metadata is added
   - Logs are normalized
   - Sensitive information is filtered

3. **Log Storage**:
   - Processed logs are stored in the repository
   - Log indices are created and managed
   - Storage policies are applied
   - Log retention is managed

4. **Log Access**:
   - Users access logs via API or UI
   - Logs can be queried and filtered
   - Log analysis is performed
   - Log statistics are generated

## Integration with Other Components

The Logger integrates with all platform components:

- **All Platform Services**: Receives logs via Kafka
- **API Gateway**: Exposes logging APIs
- **Monitoring & Fault Tolerance**: Provides logs for monitoring
- **Admin UI**: Integrates with the logging UI

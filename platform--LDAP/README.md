# LDAP Authentication Server

The LDAP Authentication Server is a critical security component of the Distributed IoT Platform responsible for user authentication, authorization, and identity management.

## Overview

The LDAP Authentication Server provides centralized authentication and authorization services for the Distributed IoT Platform. It manages user identities, authenticates users, and controls access to platform resources based on user roles and permissions. The LDAP server ensures that only authorized users can access the platform and its resources.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Verifies user identities
- **Authorization**: Controls access to platform resources
- **User Management**: Manages user accounts and profiles
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements role-based permissions
- **Directory Services**: Provides directory services for user information
- **Single Sign-On**: Supports single sign-on capabilities
- **Password Management**: Handles password policies and resets
- **Audit Logging**: Logs authentication and authorization activities
- **Integration**: Integrates with other platform components

## Architecture

The LDAP Authentication Server follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **LDAP Directory**: Stores user and group information
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication
- **Authorization Service**: Controls access to resources
- **User Management**: Manages user accounts
- **Role Management**: Manages roles and permissions
- **API Layer**: Provides APIs for integration
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### LDAP Directory

Stores user and group information:
- User accounts
- Group memberships
- Organizational units
- Access control lists
- Directory schema

### Authentication Service

Handles user authentication:
- Username/password authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Multi-factor authentication
- Authentication policies
- Session management

### Authorization Service

Controls access to resources:
- Permission checking
- Role-based access control
- Resource access policies
- Permission inheritance
- Access decision making

### User Management

Manages user accounts:
- User creation and deletion
- Profile management
- Account status
- Password management
- User attributes

### Role Management

Manages roles and permissions:
- Role definitions
- Permission assignments
- Role hierarchies
- Role constraints
- Role mapping

### API Layer

Provides APIs for integration:
- REST APIs
- LDAP protocol support
- Authentication endpoints
- User management endpoints
- Role management endpoints

## Workflow

1. **User Registration**:
   - User accounts are created
   - User profiles are configured
   - Roles are assigned
   - Initial passwords are set

2. **Authentication**:
   - Users provide credentials
   - Credentials are verified
   - Authentication tokens are issued
   - Sessions are established

3. **Authorization**:
   - Access requests are received
   - User roles are checked
   - Permissions are evaluated
   - Access decisions are made

4. **User Management**:
   - User accounts are managed
   - Profiles are updated
   - Passwords are reset
   - Account status is controlled

## Integration with Other Components

The LDAP Authentication Server integrates with several other platform components:

- **API Gateway**: Provides authentication and authorization
- **Admin UI**: Manages users and roles
- **Logger**: Logs authentication activities
- **Monitoring & Fault Tolerance**: Reports server health
- **All Platform Services**: Verifies user access

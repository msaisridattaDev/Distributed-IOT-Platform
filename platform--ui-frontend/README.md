   - Deployment progress is monitored

4. **Application Monitoring**:
   - User views application dashboard
   - Performance metrics are displayed
   - Logs are accessible
   - Alerts are shown

5. **Sensor Management**:
   - User registers and configures sensors
   - Sensor data is visualized
   - Sensor commands are sent
   - Sensor health is monitored

## UI Sections

The UI Frontend is organized into several sections:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of applications and platform
2. **Applications**: Application management
3. **Deployments**: Deployment management
4. **Monitoring**: Application monitoring
5. **Sensors**: Sensor management
6. **Logs**: Log viewer

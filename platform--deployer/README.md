# Deployer

The Deployer is a critical component of the Distributed IoT Platform responsible for deploying applications to the distributed nodes in the system.

## Overview

The Deployer handles the actual deployment of applications to the distributed nodes in the platform. It receives deployment requests from the Scheduler, prepares the application for deployment, and manages the deployment process across the selected nodes. The Deployer ensures that applications are correctly deployed, configured, and started on the target nodes.

## Key Features

- **Application Deployment**: Deploys applications to selected nodes
- **Container Management**: Creates and manages Docker containers for applications
- **Configuration Management**: Handles application configuration
- **Dependency Resolution**: Ensures all application dependencies are satisfied
- **Deployment Verification**: Verifies successful deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Handles deployment failures with rollback
- **Deployment Tracking**: Maintains records of all deployments
- **Scaling Support**: Supports scaling applications across multiple nodes

## Architecture

The Deployer follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Deployment Manager**: Coordinates the overall deployment process
- **Container Builder**: Builds Docker containers for applications
- **Configuration Handler**: Manages application configuration
- **Deployment Executor**: Executes the deployment on target nodes
- **Verification Module**: Verifies successful deployment
- **Rollback Handler**: Manages deployment rollbacks
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### Deployment Manager

The central component that coordinates the deployment process:
- Receives deployment requests from the Scheduler
- Plans the deployment strategy
- Coordinates the deployment steps
- Tracks deployment status
- Reports deployment results

### Container Builder

Responsible for building Docker containers for applications:
- Processes application code and dependencies
- Creates Docker images
- Tags and registers images
- Manages image versions

### Configuration Handler

Manages application configuration:
- Processes application configuration files
- Handles environment variables
- Manages secrets and credentials
- Creates configuration volumes

### Deployment Executor

Executes the deployment on target nodes:
- Connects to target nodes
- Pulls Docker images
- Creates and starts containers
- Sets up networking
- Configures volumes and mounts

### Verification Module

Verifies successful deployment:
- Checks container status
- Verifies application health
- Runs deployment tests
- Validates configuration

### Rollback Handler

Manages deployment rollbacks in case of failures:
- Detects deployment failures
- Stops and removes failed containers
- Restores previous version
- Reports rollback status

## Workflow

1. **Deployment Request**:
   - Receives deployment request from the Scheduler
   - Validates the request
   - Retrieves application code and configuration

2. **Preparation**:
   - Builds Docker image for the application
   - Prepares configuration
   - Resolves dependencies

3. **Deployment**:
   - Connects to target nodes
   - Deploys containers to nodes
   - Configures networking and volumes
   - Starts the application

4. **Verification**:
   - Verifies container status
   - Checks application health
   - Validates deployment

5. **Completion**:
   - Records deployment details
   - Reports deployment status
   - Notifies the Scheduler

## Integration with Other Components

The Deployer integrates with several other platform components:

- **Scheduler**: Receives deployment requests
- **Node Manager**: Gets node information for deployment
- **Monitoring & Fault Tolerance**: Reports deployment status
- **Logger**: Logs deployment activities
- **API Gateway**: Exposes deployment APIs

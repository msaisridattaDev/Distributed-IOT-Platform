# Scheduler

The Scheduler is a core component of the Distributed IoT Platform responsible for scheduling application deployments, managing resource allocation, and coordinating deployment workflows.

## Overview

The Scheduler plays a crucial role in the Distributed IoT Platform by managing the scheduling of application deployments. It determines when and where applications should be deployed based on resource availability, deployment policies, and user requirements. The Scheduler works closely with the Node Manager to allocate resources and with the Deployer to execute deployments.

## Key Features

- **Deployment Scheduling**: Schedules application deployments based on time and resources
- **Resource Allocation**: Coordinates with Node Manager for resource allocation
- **Deployment Planning**: Creates deployment plans for applications
- **Priority Management**: Handles deployment priorities
- **Queue Management**: Manages deployment queues
- **Dependency Resolution**: Ensures deployment dependencies are satisfied
- **Scheduling Policies**: Implements various scheduling policies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolves scheduling conflicts

## Architecture

The Scheduler follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Scheduling Engine**: Core scheduling algorithm
- **Resource Manager**: Manages resource allocation
- **Queue Manager**: Handles deployment queues
- **Policy Manager**: Implements scheduling policies
- **Dependency Resolver**: Resolves deployment dependencies
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### Scheduling Engine

The core component that implements the scheduling algorithm:
- Processes deployment requests
- Applies scheduling policies
- Creates deployment schedules
- Resolves scheduling conflicts
- Optimizes resource utilization

### Resource Manager

Manages resource allocation for deployments:
- Coordinates with Node Manager
- Tracks resource availability
- Allocates resources for deployments
- Handles resource constraints
- Optimizes resource distribution

### Queue Manager

Manages deployment queues:
- Maintains priority queues
- Handles queue ordering
- Processes queue entries
- Implements queue policies
- Manages queue capacity

### Policy Manager

Implements scheduling policies:
- Defines scheduling rules
- Applies policy constraints
- Handles policy violations
- Supports custom policies
- Manages policy priorities

### Dependency Resolver

Resolves deployment dependencies:
- Identifies deployment dependencies
- Creates dependency graphs
- Ensures correct deployment order
- Handles circular dependencies
- Validates dependency satisfaction

## Workflow

1. **Deployment Request**:
   - Receives deployment request from API Gateway
   - Validates the request
   - Adds the request to the appropriate queue

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Coordinates with Node Manager for resource allocation
   - Checks resource availability
   - Reserves resources for deployment

3. **Scheduling**:
   - Applies scheduling policies
   - Resolves dependencies
   - Creates deployment schedule
   - Resolves conflicts

4. **Deployment Initiation**:
   - Sends deployment request to Deployer
   - Monitors deployment progress
   - Handles deployment failures

5. **Completion**:
   - Records deployment details
   - Releases resources
   - Updates deployment status

## Integration with Other Components

The Scheduler integrates with several other platform components:

- **API Gateway**: Receives scheduling requests
- **Node Manager**: Coordinates resource allocation
- **Deployer**: Initiates deployments
- **Validator & Workflow**: Validates deployment configurations
- **Monitoring & Fault Tolerance**: Monitors deployment status
- **Logger**: Logs scheduling activities

# Validator & Workflow

The Validator & Workflow component is responsible for validating application configurations and managing application workflows in the Distributed IoT Platform.

## Overview

The Validator & Workflow component plays a crucial role in ensuring the correctness and consistency of application deployments in the Distributed IoT Platform. It validates application configurations against platform requirements, manages application workflows, and coordinates the deployment process. This component works closely with the Scheduler and Deployer to ensure successful application deployments.

## Key Features

- **Configuration Validation**: Validates application configurations
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures configuration adheres to required schemas
- **Dependency Validation**: Validates application dependencies
- **Resource Validation**: Verifies resource requirements
- **Workflow Management**: Manages application deployment workflows
- **State Tracking**: Tracks application deployment states
- **Transition Management**: Manages state transitions
- **Error Handling**: Handles validation and workflow errors
- **Notification**: Notifies relevant components of workflow events

## Architecture

The Validator & Workflow component follows a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Configuration Validator**: Validates application configurations
- **Schema Manager**: Manages configuration schemas
- **Dependency Validator**: Validates application dependencies
- **Resource Validator**: Validates resource requirements
- **Workflow Engine**: Manages application workflows
- **State Manager**: Tracks workflow states
- **Transition Manager**: Manages state transitions
- **Kafka Integration**: Communicates with other platform services

## Components

### Configuration Validator

Validates application configurations:
- Checks configuration format
- Validates configuration fields
- Ensures required fields are present
- Validates field values
- Checks configuration consistency

### Schema Manager

Manages configuration schemas:
- Stores configuration schemas
- Provides schema validation
- Manages schema versions
- Supports schema evolution
- Handles schema compatibility

### Dependency Validator

Validates application dependencies:
- Checks dependency availability
- Validates dependency versions
- Ensures dependency compatibility
- Resolves dependency conflicts
- Validates dependency chains

### Resource Validator

Validates resource requirements:
- Checks resource specifications
- Validates resource availability
- Ensures resource compatibility
- Validates resource constraints
- Checks resource quotas

### Workflow Engine

Manages application workflows:
- Defines workflow steps
- Coordinates workflow execution
- Handles workflow branching
- Manages workflow timeouts
- Supports workflow customization

### State Manager

Tracks workflow states:
- Maintains workflow state
- Records state history
- Provides state queries
- Handles state persistence
- Supports state recovery

### Transition Manager

Manages state transitions:
- Defines valid transitions
- Validates transition conditions
- Executes transition actions
- Handles transition failures
- Notifies of state changes

## Workflow

1. **Configuration Submission**:
   - Application configuration is submitted
   - Configuration is parsed and validated
   - Schema validation is performed
   - Dependencies are validated
   - Resources are validated

2. **Workflow Initialization**:
   - Workflow is created for the application
   - Initial state is set
   - Workflow steps are defined
   - Workflow is registered

3. **Workflow Execution**:
   - Workflow steps are executed
   - State transitions are managed
   - Progress is tracked
   - Events are generated

4. **Completion or Failure**:
   - Workflow completes successfully or fails
   - Final state is recorded
   - Notifications are sent
   - Results are reported

## API Endpoints

The Validator & Workflow component exposes several internal API endpoints:

### Validation

- **`POST /validate/configuration`**: Validate application configuration
- **`POST /validate/dependencies`**: Validate application dependencies
- **`POST /validate/resources`**: Validate resource requirements
- **`GET /schemas`**: List available schemas
- **`GET /schemas/{schema_id}`**: Get schema details

### Workflow Management

- **`POST /workflows`**: Create a new workflow
- **`GET /workflows`**: List all workflows
- **`GET /workflows/{workflow_id}`**: Get workflow details
- **`PUT /workflows/{workflow_id}/state`**: Update workflow state
- **`GET /workflows/{workflow_id}/history`**: Get workflow history

## Configuration

The Validator & Workflow component is configured through several files:

- **`config.json`**: Main configuration file with settings for:
  - Server port and host
  - Validation rules
  - Workflow definitions
  - State transition rules

- **`schemas/`**: Directory containing JSON schemas for validation

## Integration with Other Components

The Validator & Workflow component integrates with several other platform components:

- **Scheduler**: Coordinates application scheduling
- **Deployer**: Manages application deployment
- **Node Manager**: Validates resource availability
- **Logger**: Logs validation and workflow activities
- **API Gateway**: Exposes validation and workflow APIs

## Validation Rules

The component implements several types of validation rules:

1. **Format Validation**: Ensures correct format (JSON, YAML, etc.)
2. **Schema Validation**: Validates against JSON schemas
3. **Semantic Validation**: Checks for semantic correctness
4. **Dependency Validation**: Validates dependencies
5. **Resource Validation**: Validates resource requirements
6. **Security Validation**: Checks for security issues

## Workflow States

The component defines several standard workflow states:

1. **Submitted**: Configuration submitted
2. **Validated**: Configuration validated
3. **Scheduled**: Deployment scheduled
4. **Deploying**: Deployment in progress
5. **Deployed**: Deployment completed
6. **Failed**: Deployment failed
7. **Cancelled**: Deployment cancelled
